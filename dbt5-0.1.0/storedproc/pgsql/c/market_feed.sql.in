 * Market Feed transaction

 * The Market-Feed transaction receives the latest prices for securities
 * that come in on the market feed ticker.
 *
 * Based on TPC-E Standard Specification Draft Revision 1.10.0 Clause 3.3.3.3.

/*
 * Frame 1
 * responsible to find the symbol and to modify the row in the LAST_TRADE table
 * for that symbol with the new price, to add the quantity traded to the daily
 * volume, and to modify the last trade date
 */

/*
 * FIXME: The specification seems to say indicate that the correct way to
 * implement this frame is to have this transaction make the calls to the
 * Market Exchange Emulator.  Instead we'll have the stored function return
 * the data that should be sent to the Market Exchange Emulator and have the
 * Brokerage House Emulator do that.
