Usage varies depending on the database management system used.  See addition
README-* for specific instructions.

Comments regarding database scale:

The minimum "valid" configuration is supposed to be 5000 customer with 300
initial trade days and a scale factor of 500.  An example to build this would
be:

	dbt5-pgsql-build-db -c 5000 -i 5000 -t 5000 -s 500 -w 300

Although not verified, through testing there appeared to be a significantly
higher number of invalid and warning results when using a database scaled
smaller than this..  While it is possible to use the programs provided and have
the kit build something to the small size of:

	dbt5-pgsql-build-db -c 1000 -i 1000 -t 1000 -s 500 -w 1

This may result is a high level of failed transactions.
